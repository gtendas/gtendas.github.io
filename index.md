I'm a PhD student in mathematics at [Macquarie University](https://mq.edu.au) under the supervision of [Steve Lack](http://maths.mq.edu.au/~slack/). My research interests include category theory and related areas of pure mathematics; at the moment I'm working on enriched and accessible categories.

I'm currently organizing of the [Australian Category Seminar](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/groups/coact/seminar/), if you want to give a talk feel free to contact me by email.
