I currently hold a Postdoc position at Masaryk University in Brno to work on "Enriched Categories and their Applications". 

Before that I was a PhD student in mathematics at [Macquarie University](https://mq.edu.au) under the supervision of <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/steve-lack" style="font-style:italic, color:black">Steve Lack</a>. My research interests include category theory and related areas of pure mathematics; at the moment I'm working on enriched and accessible categories.
