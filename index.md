I currently hold a Postdoc position at the [University of Manchester](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/) under an EPSRC postdoctoral fellowship.

I did my PhD in mathematics at [Macquarie University](https://mq.edu.au) under the supervision of <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/steve-lack">Steve Lack</a>; directly after that I held a postdoc position at [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/en) in Brno. My research interests include category theory and related areas of pure mathematics; at the moment I'm working on enriched categories and logic.
