I currently hold a Postdoc position at [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/en) in Brno to work on "Enriched Categories and their Applications". From January 2024 I will move to the [University of Manchester](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/) to start an EPSRC postdoctoral fellowship [EP/X027139/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/X027139/1).

Before that I was a PhD student in mathematics at [Macquarie University](https://mq.edu.au) under the supervision of <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/steve-lack" style="color:black">Steve Lack</a>. My research interests include category theory and related areas of pure mathematics; at the moment I'm working on enriched and accessible categories.
