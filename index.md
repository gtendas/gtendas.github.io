I currently hold a Postdoc position at the [University of Manchester](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/) under an EPSRC postdoctoral fellowship. I'm part of the group led by <a href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/nicola.gambino/">Nicola Gambino</a> where you can also find <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/stenzel/home">Raffael Stenzel</a>, and Nicola's PhD students <a href="https://calum-hughes.github.io/">Calum Hughes</a>, <a href="https://bpl28.user.srcf.net/">Bruno Lindan</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ngo-hang-chan/home">Ngo Hang-Chan</a> (see <a href="https://manchester-ct.github.io/index.html">The University of Manchester Category Theory Group</a>.

I did my PhD in mathematics at [Macquarie University](https://mq.edu.au), in Sydney, under the supervision of <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/steve-lack">Steve Lack</a>. After that I held a postdoc position at [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/en) in Brno. My research interests include category theory and related areas of pure mathematics; at the moment I'm working on enriched categories and logic.

With Nicola Gambino I recently organized the workshop [Categorical Logic and Higher Categories](https://gtendas.github.io/clhc/) that took place at the University of Manchester in December 2024.
